This Anistrano Deploy script for [Ansible-Hosting](https://github.com/Greg-Boggs/ansible-hosting).

To use this playbook outside of my Ansible Hosting environment just git clone a project to a www folder 1 level above this README.

    ansible-playbook -i hosts deploy.yml

This will deploy the repo to /var/www/current/html
